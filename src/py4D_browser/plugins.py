    The py4D_browser plugin mechanics are inspired by Nion Swift:
    https://nionswift.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/plugins.html

    Plugins should create a module in the py4d_browser_plugin namespace
    and should define a class with the `plugin_id` attribute and an
    `api_version` attribute declaring the plugin API version it was
    written against (see py4D_browser.plugin_api).

    On loading the class is initialized using
        ExamplePlugin(api=..., plugin_menu=..., plugin_action=...)
    with all arguments passed as kwargs:

    * `api` is an instance of the versioned plugin API matching the
      plugin's declared `api_version`.
    * `parent` (the raw DataViewer) is passed only when the plugin sets
      `full_access = True`.

    A plugin that does not declare `api_version`, or that requires an API
    version this browser does not provide, is logged and skipped; loading
    the remaining plugins continues.

    A plugin that sets `dev_only = True` is for development/testing use and
    is skipped **silently** (no log output) unless the `gui/dev_plugins`
    setting in the config file is truthy. This lets development plugins be
    committed and tracked in-repo without exposing them to end users, who
    must opt in by setting `gui/dev_plugins = true`.
