"""
The versioned plugin API for py4DGUI.

Plugins declare which version of this API they were written against with a
class-level attribute::

    api_version = (1, 0)

The loader resolves that against :data:`SUPPORTED_API_VERSIONS` and passes
the plugin an instance of the matching API class. Within a major version the
API is only ever extended: existing methods keep their signatures and
behavior, so a plugin written against an older minor version of a major
continues to work.

Multiple major versions coexist: when a new major version is introduced, the
old class is kept in the registry so that plugins written against it keep
loading. The API objects are the "glue" between plugins and the DataViewer:
their outgoing interface is stable for the lifetime of the major version,
while their implementation (which calls into the viewer) may be updated as
the GUI evolves.

Plugins must declare ``api_version``; a plugin that does not, or that
requires a version this browser does not provide, is logged and skipped.
Plugins that set ``full_access = True`` additionally receive the raw
``DataViewer`` as ``parent`` (bypassing the versioned surface); everyone
else interacts with the browser solely through the API object passed as
``api``.
